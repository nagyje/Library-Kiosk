# Library-Kiosk
Project for Data Structures at East Tennessee State University

This project was designed to introduce trees (specifically AVL trees) and practice
working with/manipulating them. The books are loaded from the books.csv file into the AVL tree,
and the user is given a few options to manipulate the kiosk system. From the terminal, the user can
add a book, remove a book, and change the key (author, title, publisher) that the tree is sorted on.
Functionality for a preorder transversal was added to check if the key sorting functions worked properly.

Creating an AVL tree from scratch was not required, so I sourced one from online.
